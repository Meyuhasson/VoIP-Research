"VoIP Anomaly detection using ML" article supplement <\br>
In this repo you will find a meaningful files reletaed to the article "VoIP Anomaly detection using ML" article supplement. <\br>
All the code files, data, etc, which used for the research, have been uploaded to this repo. <\br>
If there is any missing data, files, or misunderstandings with any of the files, please contact us at: edenmeyu@post.bgu.ac.il <\br>
and we would do the best efforts for solving it. <\br>
In the Code directory you can find the python code which used for the features' extraction produced from the WAV files collected <\br>
and can be found in the Data directory. <\br>
the directory contains 2 relevant .py files: audio_utils, main. <\br>
audio_utils - contains the functions which return features, statistical values and visualization of the data inputed (WAV files). <\br>
main implements the relevant functions which for production of the features' extraction CSV file. <\br>
A significant part of the python code have been assisted by Librosa library (https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) <\br>

Hope you will find out our project was helpfull :) <\br>
