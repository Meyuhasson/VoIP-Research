In this repo, we represent a variety of models for the detection of malicious VoIP calls - specifically, we are looking for RTPm malicious sessions.


In this repo, you will find meaningful files related to the article "Detecting Attacks in Voice-Over-IP Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Using Anomaly Detection Techniques" article by Eden Meyuhas & Yuval Elovici.
All the code files, data, etc, used for the research, have been uploaded to this repo. 
If there is any missing data, files, or misunderstandings with any of the files, please contact us at: edenmeyu@post.bgu.ac.il 
and we would do our best efforts for solving it. 
In the Code directory, you can find the python code used for the features extraction produced from the WAV files collected 
and can be found in the Data directory. 
the directory contains 2 relevant .py files: audio_utils, main. 
audio_utils - contains the functions which return features, statistical values, and visualization of the data. 
the main file implements the relevant functions for the production of the features' extraction CSV file. 
A significant part of the python code has been assisted by the Librosa library (https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) 


Hope you will find out our project was helpful :)
