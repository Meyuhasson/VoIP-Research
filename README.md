"VoIP Anomaly detection using ML" article supplement 
In this repo you will find a meaningful files reletaed to the article "VoIP Anomaly detection using ML" article supplement. 
All the code files, data, etc, which used for the research, have been uploaded to this repo. 
If there is any missing data, files, or misunderstandings with any of the files, please contact us at: edenmeyu@post.bgu.ac.il 
and we would do the best efforts for solving it. 
In the Code directory you can find the python code which used for the features' extraction produced from the WAV files collected 
and can be found in the Data directory. 
the directory contains 2 relevant .py files: audio_utils, main. 
audio_utils - contains the functions which return features, statistical values and visualization of the data inputed (WAV files). 
main implements the relevant functions which for production of the features' extraction CSV file. 
A significant part of the python code have been assisted by Librosa library (https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) 

Hope you will find out our project was helpfull :)
